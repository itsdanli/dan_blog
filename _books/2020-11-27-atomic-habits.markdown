title: Atomic Habits Notes

### 1. Make it Obvious
The brain is a prediction machine — continuously taking in information and analyzing it. With enough practice you can predict outcomes without consciously thinking about it

Habits are governed by the unconscious. You will fall into old patterns before you even realize what's happening

A Simple exercise to become aware of your own habits, make a list of your daily habits

Sample:

- Wake up
- Turn off alarm
- Check my phone
- Go to bathroom
- Weigh myself
- Take a shower
- Brush teeth


Once you have a full list, look at each behavior and ask if this is a good habit, bad habit or a neutral habit

Say out loud before doing a bad habit, what the consequences are. they make the consequences seem more real


Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing

Process of behavior change always starts with awareness


Best way to start a new habit

Most effective was group that had to formulate a plan and say out loud, “I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [Day] at [time] in [place]

Implementation intentions are effective for sticking to our goals


Habit Stacking

Many human behaviors follow a cycle. When you accomplish something, the brain wonders what can I do next?

One of the best way to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is habit stacking


Behavior is a function of person in their environment. In 1952, Hawkins stern, described phenomenon called suggestion impulse buying “triggered when a shopper sees a product for first time and visualizes a need for it”. You will occasionally buy products not because you want it but how they are presented to you.


Creating obvious visual cues can draw your attention toward a desired habit


Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment

Gradually habits become associated now with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. Context becomes the cue

It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.


Creating a more disciplined environment is a way to achieve habits rather than becoming a more disciplined person.


Once a habit is formed, unlikely to be forgotten

people with high self control tend to spend less time in tempting situations, easier to avoid temptation than resist it


Self control is a short term strategy not long term

Chapter 2: Make it Attractive

the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same as when you anticipate a reward.

Difference is wanting and liking


Temptation building is one way to apply psychology known as premarket principle. . More probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors


Habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:

1. After [current habit], I will [habit i need]

2. After [habit i need] , i will [habit i want]



￼

⁃ if a behavior can get us approval, respect/praise we find it attractive



Walk slowly, but never backward

There is a difference in being in motion and taking action. In motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning — good things but no results. Action will deliver an outcome


No need to map out every feature of new habit. Just need to practice it. Get your reps in


More you repeat an activity, more structure fo brain changes to become efficient at that activity. Neurons that wire together fire together.


Make it easy

Introduce a little bit of friction into the habits you want to break and lessen the friction in habits you want to build


Two minute rule - “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”


Read before bed each night becomes “read one page”

Do thirty min of yoga becomes “take out my yoga mat”

Study for class becomes “open my notes”

“Fold the laundry become “fold one pair of socks”



How to make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible


You can make your bad habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a commitment device


Commitment devices are Seoul because they enable you to take advantage of good intentions before you fall victim to temptation.


Best way to break a habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you dont even have to act


4th rule make it satisfying

We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.

The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.


Create visual cues for yourself to accomplish a task. Paper clips from jar to jar


When you miss a habit

Try to never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back into as quickly as possible


When successful people fail, they rebound quickly. Don’t let losses eat into your compounding


When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior


Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a bigger picture.


The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it.


When the consequences are severe, people learn quickly.


Genes can predispose but they dont predetermine


Tailor your habits to your personality and what you naturally gravitate toward


Yerkes-Dodson law - optimal level of arousal as midpoint between boredom and anxiety


Boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self improvement


Who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing same lifts over and over and over.


You have to fall in love with boredom

￼


There is power in reflection and review to long term improvement of habits. It makes you aware of your mistakes and helps consider possible paths for improvement.


Annual review

Tally habits for year, how many workouts, reflect on progress by answering:

1. What went well this year?

2. What didnt go so well this year

3. What did i learn?

6 months later, during summer

Integrity report

Helps realize what went wrong to get back on course

1. What are the core values that drive my life and work?

2. How am i living and working with integrity right now?

3. How can i set a higher standard in the future?


The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it


More you let single belief define you, less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you


“Plants are born tender and pliant;

dead, they are brittle and dry.

Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible

is a disciple of death.

Whoever is soft and yielding

is a disciple of life.

The hard and stiff will be broken.

The soft and supple will prevail.

—LAO TZU”



“The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.

Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery

Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time.

The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.”
