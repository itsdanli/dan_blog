> “Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail. —LAO TZU”


# 1. Make it Obvious
The brain is a prediction machine — continuously taking in information and analyzing it. With enough practice you can predict outcomes without consciously thinking about it

Habits are governed by the unconscious. _You will fall into old patterns before you even realize what's happening_

A Simple exercise to become aware of your own habits, make a list of your daily habits

_Example:_
- Wake up
- Turn off alarm
- Check my phone
- Go to bathroom
- Weigh myself
- Take a shower
- Brush teeth

Once you have a full list, look at each behavior and ask if this is a good habit, bad habit or a neutral habit. _Say out loud before doing a bad habit, what the consequences are. They make the consequences seem more real._

Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing

Behavior change starts with awareness.

#### Best way to start a new habit

Most effective was group that had to formulate a plan and say out loud, _“I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on `[day]` at `[time]` in `[place]`_

#### Habit Stacking

_Many human behaviors follow a cycle. When you accomplish something, the brain wonders what can I do next?_

> One of the best way to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top.


Behavior is a function of person in their environment. In 1952, Hawkins stern, described phenomenon called **suggestion impulse** buying _“triggered when a shopper sees a product for first time and visualizes a need for it”_. We may want to buy product based off how it's presented to us.

> Creating obvious visual cues can direct us to a particular habit

_Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment_

- Gradually habits become associated now with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. Context becomes the cue.
- It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.
- Creating a more disciplined environment is a way to achieve habits rather than becoming a more disciplined person.

**Once a habit is formed, unlikely to be forgotten**

People with high self control tend to spend less time in tempting situations, easier to avoid temptation than resist it

Self control is a short term strategy not **long term**

# 2. Make it Attractive

The reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same as when you anticipate a reward.

Difference is wanting and liking

Temptation building is one way to apply psychology known as _premarket principle_. More probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.


Habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:
1. After `[current habit]`, I will `[habit i need]`
2. After `[habit i need]` , i will `[habit i want]`

If a behavior can get us approval, respect/praise we find it attractive

Walk slowly, but never backward

There is a difference in being in motion and taking action. In motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning — good things but no results. Action will deliver an outcome.

No need to map out every feature of new habit. Just need to practice it. Get your reps in

More you repeat an activity, more structure for brain changes to become efficient at that activity. Neurons that wire together fire together.

# 3. Make it easy

#### Introduce a little bit of friction into the habits you want to break and lessen the friction in habits you want to build

- Two minute rule - “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”
- Read before bed each night becomes “read one page”
- Do thirty min of yoga becomes “take out my yoga mat”
- Study for class becomes “open my notes”

#### How to make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible

- You can make your bad habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a commitment device
- Commitment devices are Seoul because they enable you to take advantage of good intentions before you fall victim to temptation.
- Best way to break a habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you dont even have to act.

#### Two minute rule

- Making a tiny action, a simple act, but doing the same way habitualizes it.
- Example used was person who hailed a taaxi cab to the gym every morning. Moment taxi was hailed, ritual of working out was in progress.

# 4. Make it satisfying

We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.

The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.

Create visual cues for yourself to accomplish a task. Paper clips from jar to jar


#### When you miss a habit

- Try to never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back into as quickly as possible
- When successful people fail, they rebound quickly. Don’t let losses eat into your compounding


When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior

Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a bigger picture.

The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it.

When the consequences are severe, people learn quickly.

Genes can predispose but they dont predetermine

Tailor your habits to your personality and what you naturally gravitate toward

Yerkes-Dodson law - optimal level of arousal as midpoint between boredom and anxiety

**Boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self improvement**

*Interesting point:* Who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing same lifts over and over and over.

There is power in reflection and review to long term improvement of habits. It makes you aware of your mistakes and helps consider possible paths for improvement.

### Annual review

Tally habits for year and reflect on progress by answering:

1. What went well this year?
2. What didnt go so well this year
3. What did i learn?

### 6 months later, during summer
#### Integrity report

_Helps realize what went wrong to get back on course_

1. What are the core values that drive my life and work?
2. How am i living and working with integrity right now?
3. How can i set a higher standard in the future?

**The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it**

More you let single belief define you, less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you

The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.

**Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery**

Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time.

"The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.”
