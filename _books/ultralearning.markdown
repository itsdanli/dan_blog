## Notes

**What exactly is Ultralearning?**

It is a strategy to acquire skills that is both direct and intense
- it is a strategy
- self directed, how do you make decisions about what to learn and why
- intense. All ultra learners took unusual steps to maximize effectiveness in learning

**Rapidly learning hard skills can have a greater impact than years of mediocre striving on the job**

We are increasingly living in a world of _skill polarization_ where top performers do better than the rest

#### Nine universal principles that underlie ultralearning projects
1. **Metalearning:** draw a map: start by learning how to learn the subject or skill you want to tackle. Discover how to do good research and how to draw on your past competencies to learn new skills more easily
2. **Focus:** cultivate ability to concentrate. Carbe out chunks when you can focus on learning and make it easy to just do it.
3. **Directness:** learn by doing things you want to be good at. Don't trade off for other tasks just because more convenient or comfortable.
4. **Drill:** attack your weakest point - be _ruthless_ in improving your weakest points, break down complext skills into small parts, master those parts and then build back toegther again
5. **Retrieval:** testing isn't just for assessing knowledge, it helps create it too. Actively recall information
6. **Feedback:** don't dodge punches, feedback is always critical. Know how to use it without _ego_ getting in the way.
7. **Retention:** Understand what you forget and why. Learn to remember things not just now, but forever.
8. **Intuition:** develop your intuition through playing and exploring concepts and skills. Understand how understanding works, don't do cheap tricks of memorization.
9. **Experimentation:** explore outside your comfort zone, all the above principles are just starting points.

### Principle 1 -- Metalearning

prefix _meta_ comes from Greek term meaning _beyond_. Signifies when something deals with higher layer of abstraction. In the case of metalearning = _learning about learning_

**Determining Why, What and How**

Breaking down what you want to learn into these 3 questions, allows you to understand your motivation to learn

**Why?**

_Intrinsic vs. Instrumental_

_Intrinsic_: Pursuing for their own sake. e.g. Speak French, but not sure how you'll use.

_Instrumental_: Pursuing for the sake of a greater goal. e.g. Speak French to advance your career as a linguist.
- Determine whether skill or topic will help you achieve your goal.
- **Trick is to do your research first.**

_**Expert Interview Method**_

- Talk to people already who achieved what you want to achieve.
    - You can use forums, twitter, linkedin to find these people.
- If not aligned with your own goals, may spend a lot of time learning things that aren't important to you.

**What?**

- Write down 3 columns: _Concepts, Facts, Procedures_
    - Concepts - ideas that need to be understood, e.g. math/physics.
    - Facts - what needs to be memorized e.g. language has vocabulary, calculus know how derivatives work.
    - Procedures - what needs to be practiced. e.g. learning language requires memorizing facts... pronounciation requires practice.

**Draw your map**

Drawing your map will give you a good idea of what major learning bottlenecks.

Might look at particular features of your columns, and find methods to master more effectively. 

**How?**

_Benchmarking and Emphasize/Exclude Method_

_**Benchmarking**_

Find common ways in which people learn subject. e.g. learning subject taught in school, might look at curriculum used in schools.

_**Emphasize/Exclude**_

For conceptual subjects, probably better to stick closer to benchmark until you learn bit more.

This method involves first identifiying areas that alight with first part of research. e.g. Idea of going to Paris for two weeks. Focus on pronounciation rahter than being able to spell correctly.

There will always be uncertainty in your approach. _Research can be a form of procrastination_. Find the sweet spot between insufficient research and analysis.

**10 Percent Rule**

Invest 10 percent of total expected learning time into research prior to starting. Expect six months learning, 4 hours per week -- 10 hours/two weeks doing your research.

**Diminishing returns and marginal benefit calculation**
