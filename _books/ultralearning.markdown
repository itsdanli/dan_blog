## Notes

**What exactly is Ultralearning?**

It is a strategy to acquire skills that is both direct and intense
- it is a strategy
- self directed, how do you make decisions about what to learn and why
- intense. All ultra learners took unusual steps to maximize effectiveness in learning

**Rapidly learning hard skills can have a greater impact than years of mediocre striving on the job**

We are increasingly living in a world of _skill polarization_ where top performers do better than the rest

#### Nine universal principles that underlie ultralearning projects
1. **Metalearning:** draw a map: start by learning how to learn the subject or skill you want to tackle. Discover how to do good research and how to draw on your past competencies to learn new skills more easily
2. **Focus:** cultivate ability to concentrate. Carbe out chunks when you can focus on learning and make it easy to just do it.
3. **Directness:** learn by doing things you want to be good at. Don't trade off for other tasks just because more convenient or comfortable.
4. **Drill:** attack your weakest point - be _ruthless_ in improving your weakest points, break down complext skills into small parts, master those parts and then build back toegther again
5. **Retrieval:** testing isn't just for assessing knowledge, it helps create it too. Actively recall information
6. **Feedback:** don't dodge punches, feedback is always critical. Know how to use it without _ego_ getting in the way.
7. **Retention:** Understand what you forget and why. Learn to remember things not just now, but forever.
8. **Intuition:** develop your intuition through playing and exploring concepts and skills. Understand how understanding works, don't do cheap tricks of memorization.
9. **Experimentation:** explore outside your comfort zone, all the above principles are just starting points.
