> "Be yourself, everyone else is taken" -- Oscar Wilde

This site was created for preservation of my thoughts, an area to keep track of books I've read, and a place to document any projects I have worked on.


## About Me

#### As of 2021, I have 4 more years left in my 20s. **My focus for these next several years will be on discovery and creation.**

It's actually quite a psychologically pivotal time as I write this, soon to turn 26 having spent the exact midpoint of my 20s in pandemic America. When I turned 25, I felt as if I had triggered a psychological milestone... I felt this renewed sense of urgency to evaluate my life and make sure I some level of "figured out" in place. Objectively, 25 is completely arbitrary and has no true difference i.e. 4 to 5 and 26 to 27, however, every year feels quicker than the last (proportionality to years alive, this makes sense) and reminds me that life is finite. 

I've heard 2020 was a time of reflection for many; A time when people were forced to take a step back and evaluate how they had been leading their lives up to that point. For myself, I had taken a step in this journey of reflection earlier on in my college years and went through many emotional peaks and troughs. Understandably so, I am still in the nascent stages of life... like many others as we begin to wade through the endless noise factory that is the society we live in -- iterating on our uncrystallized identities in an uncertain environment -- with time and experience those identities become more crystallized. What I've come to realize so far is those who can come to peace with the noise factory that is our society and the biological noise factory that is the human brain are those who are truly free.


## What I'm Doing Now

#### **Living in Chicago, Illinois and developing my professional career**

After a short stint of leaving Chicago to consider other options and further develop technical skills, I am back and am currently working professionally as a trader in the proprietary trading industry. Markets have been an interest since high school so I'm very grateful to be able to gain this experience.

#### **In 2021, I'm looking to stay active and find a creative outlet**

The start of this blog is in hopes of also leading to working on other projects that can inspire creativity. I'm excited to incorporate additions into my weekly routine.

My active interests include yoga, cycling, weight lifting and running. Climbing is a real possibility I am looking into.
